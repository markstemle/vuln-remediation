#MITIGATION

The mitscript.py file is a program designed to run each of these mitigations from one console session. 

Flow Logs Activation Function (flowlogsfunct()):

Description: This function activates flow logs for selected network interfaces within the infrastructure. Flow logs are essential for capturing data about IP traffic to and from these network interfaces, enabling the monitoring and analysis of traffic patterns. This tool aids in identifying unusual or potentially harmful traffic that could signify security threats or network misconfiguration.

Comprehensive Flow Logs Function (flowlogsallfunct()):

Description: This function extends flow logs activation to encompass all network interfaces across the entire infrastructure. By providing a holistic view of the network traffic, it enhances the organization's ability to monitor, detect, and respond to anomalies and security incidents across all segments of the network.

Bucket Security Function (bucketfunct()):

Description: This function implements security measures for data storage buckets, focusing on permission settings, encryption enablement, and other security configurations. It is designed to safeguard data stored in buckets from unauthorized access and breaches, thus maintaining data integrity and confidentiality.

Shielded VM Configuration Function (shieldedvmfunct()):

Description: This function configures Shielded VMs to fortify them against rootkits and kernel-level exploits. By enabling security controls that ensure the integrity of the VM's operating system and prevent unauthorized software from running, it provides a robust defense against advanced persistent threats and malware.

Public IP Management Function (publicipfunct()):

Description: This function manages the exposure of public IP addresses associated with the organizationâ€™s assets. It involves setting up strict firewall rules and security groups to control inbound and outbound traffic, significantly reducing the vulnerability associated with public-facing endpoints.

Uniform Bucket Policy Application Function (bucketuniformfunct()):

Description: This function ensures that security policies are uniformly applied across all storage buckets within the organization. It focuses on the consistent enforcement of access controls and audit configurations, thereby minimizing the risk of security lapses due to policy inconsistencies.
